	abstract = {MedEye3d is a Julia language package designed to simplify visualizations of segmentation in three dimensional setting. Motivation to develop this application was to provide to rapidly growing Julia language scientific community tool for research in three dimensional medical images. Package is based on multiple open source software packages, yet most prominent is utilization of OpenGl specification to enable GPU acceleration. Application was tested both on Linux and Windows platforms and in both cases latency observed by the user in most common interaction like scrolling, annotation and change of displayed plane was very small. Thanks to utilization of many modern packages and methodologies developed package is providing convenient visualization in rapid prototyping with medical image segmentation algorithms. Application also is easily extendable and will be included in medical image segmentation framework that is currently in development.},
