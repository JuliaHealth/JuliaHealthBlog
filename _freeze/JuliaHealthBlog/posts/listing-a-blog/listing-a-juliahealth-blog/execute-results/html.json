We're thrilled you're interested in contributing to the JuliaHealth community blog. Whether you've just completed a fascinating analysis, developed a useful utility package, want to share insights from a research paper, or simply have a tutorial idea related to Julia in the health domain, your voice is valuable. The JuliaHealth organization is built on the collective efforts of people like you, using the power of Julia to make strides in medicine, healthcare, public health, and biomedical research.\n\nSharing your work through a blog post is a fantastic way to connect with others, showcase your achievements (big or small!), and contribute to the collective knowledge base. Don't worry if you've never written a technical blog post before or if you're new to tools like Git or Quarto. This guide is designed to walk you through the process step-by-step, making it as smooth and comfortable as possible.\n\nWe use [**Quarto**](https://quarto.org/) for our blog. It's a wonderful, open-source tool that lets you easily combine regular text (like this!), code (like Julia, R, or Python), results, and even interactive visualizations into beautiful, web-friendly articles.\n\n**The basic steps are simple:**\n\n1.  **Fork & Clone:** Make your own copy of the blog repository and download it.\n2.  **Create:** Set up a new file for your post using Quarto's simple format (`.qmd`).\n3.  **Write:** Craft your content using Markdown and maybe some code.\n4.  **Preview:** Check how it looks on your own computer.\n5.  **Share:** Submit your post for review through a GitHub Pull Request (PR).\n\nReady to begin? Let's get started!\n\n# Why Share Your Work on the JuliaHealth Blog?\n\nYou might be wondering, \"Is my work worth a blog post?\" Absolutely! Hereâ€™s why sharing matters:\n\n*   **Boost Visibility:** Your work gets seen by people specifically interested in Julia and health applications â€“ potential collaborators, users, or just curious minds!\n*   **Make an Impact:** Your tutorial could unlock a new technique for someone, your package update could solve a user's problem, or your research summary could inspire new ideas.\n*   **Learn Through Teaching:** Explaining something often solidifies your own understanding. Plus, feedback can help you refine your ideas.\n*   **Connect with the Community:** Blogging opens doors for discussion, feedback, and collaboration with peers who share your interests.\n*   **Build Your Portfolio:** It's a tangible way to document your skills and contributions, which can be great for your career or academic profile.\n*   **Give Back:** Contribute to the open-source spirit that makes communities like JuliaHealth thrive.\n\nEvery contribution, from a quick tip to a detailed project summary, adds value.\nContributions can range from Public Health, Medical-Imaging, Neurobiology, Seizure-detection, Virtual-cell modelling and Epigenetics.\n\n> Juliahealth community has close-knit community of scientists and researchers actively in the medical-field.\n![Juliahealth Ghibli vertical image](./juliahealth_vertical.png)\n\n# The Blogging Workflow: A Gentle Walkthrough\n\nLet's break down the process into manageable steps. Don't hesitate to pause and take your time with each one.\n\n## Step 1: Fork the Blog Repository (Make Your Own Copy)\n\nThink of \"forking\" as creating your own personal copy of the official JuliaHealth blog project on GitHub. This gives you a safe space to make changes without affecting the live website directly.\n\n1.  Go to the main JuliaHealth blog repository on GitHub. (`https://github.com/JuliaHealth/JuliaHealthBlog`).\n2.  Look for the \"Fork\" button, usually in the top-right corner of the page. Click it.\n3.  GitHub will ask where you want to fork the repository; choose your own GitHub account. It will take a few seconds to create your copy.\n\nYou now have a complete replica of the blog under your GitHub account (e.g., `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/JuliaHealthBlog`).\n\n## Step 2: Clone Your Fork (Download to Your Computer)\n\nNow, you need to download your newly created fork to your local computer so you can work on the files. This is called \"cloning\".\n\n1.  Open your terminal (like Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal on Mac/Linux) or your preferred Git client.\n2.  Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project (e.g., `cd Documents/Projects`).\n3.  Run the `git clone` command, replacing `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/JuliaHealthBlog.git\n    ```\n4.  Change into the newly created directory:\n\n    ```bash\n    cd JuliaHealthBlog/JuliaHealthBlog\n    ```\n\nYou now have the blog's files on your computer!\n\n## Step 3: Create Your Blog Post Files (Set Up Your Workspace)\n\nBlog posts usually live inside a specific folder within the repository, often called `posts`. We'll create a new folder just for *your* post to keep things organized.\n\n1.  **Choose a Name:** Think of a short, descriptive name for your post folder. Including the date helps keep things chronological. For example, if you're writing about DICOM tools on May 1st, 2025, you could use `2025-05-01-dicom-tools-intro`.\n2.  **Create the Folder:** In your terminal (make sure you are inside the `JuliaHealthBlog` directory), create your folder:\n\n    ```bash\n    # Example:\n    mkdir posts/2025-05-01-dicom-tools-intro\n    ```\n    (Adjust `posts/` if the directory name is different).\n3.  **Navigate Inside:**\n\n    ```bash\n    cd posts/2025-05-01-dicom-tools-intro\n    ```\n4.  **Create the Main File:** Inside this new folder, create your main blog post file. It *must* end with `.qmd`. Using `index.qmd` is a common convention, but you can use a more descriptive name if you prefer (e.g., `dicom_intro.qmd`).\n\n    ```bash\n    # Using the common convention:\n    touch index.qmd\n    # Or using a descriptive name:\n    # touch dicom_intro.qmd\n    ```\n\nThis `.qmd` file is where you'll write your actual blog post content. Any images or other files specific to your post will also go into this same folder.\n\n## Step 4: Write Your Content (The Fun Part!)\n\nNow, open your `index.qmd` (or `your_filename.qmd`) file in a text editor (like VS Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++, etc.). A Quarto file has two main parts:\n\n### a) The YAML Header (Settings for Your Post)\n\nAt the very top of the file, enclosed by ~```~ lines, is a block of text called YAML. Think of it as a configuration section that tells Quarto and the website important details about your post. It might look intimidating, but it's just key-value pairs.\n\nHereâ€™s a detailed example you can adapt:\n\n```yaml\n---\n# --- REQUIRED ---\ntitle: \"My Awesome JuliaHealth Blog Post Title\" # Be descriptive and engaging!\ndescription: \"A short (1-2 sentence) summary of your post. This appears in previews and search results.\"\nauthor: \"Your Name (Optional: Your Affiliation or GitHub Handle)\"\ndate: \"2025-05-01\" # Use YYYY-MM-DD format for the publication date (or today's date)\n\n# --- OFTEN USED / RECOMMENDED ---\ncategories: # Keywords to help people find your post\n  - julia # General category\n  - package-showcase # e.g., if showing off a package\n  - tutorial # e.g., if it's a how-to guide\n  - medical-imaging # Specific domain\n  - DICOM.jl # Specific package/tool mentioned\ntoc: true # Set to 'true' to automatically create a Table of Contents (highly recommended for longer posts)\nbibliography: ./references.bib # Tells Quarto where to find your citation list (if you have one). Keep this file in the same folder.\n# csl: ./../../ieee-with-url.csl # Path to the citation style file [confirm path]. This makes citations look consistent.\n\n# --- OPTIONAL / ADVANCED ---\n# image: false # Path to an image to show in post listings/social media previews. Place the image in this folder.\n# engine: julia # Uncomment ONLY if you have Julia code blocks (```julia) you want Quarto to run when building the site.\n# draft: true # Keep as true while writing; REMOVE or set to 'false' when ready to publish.\n---\n```\n\n**Don't stress about getting this perfect initially.** The title, author, date, description, and categories are the most important to start with.\n\n### b) The Main Content (Using Markdown)\n\nBelow the ~```~ YAML block, you write your actual content using **Markdown**. Markdown is a simple text formatting syntax that's easy to learn. Quarto adds extra features on top.\n\nHere are the basics:\n\n*   **Headings:** Use `#` for the main title (Quarto often uses the `title` from YAML, so you might start with `##` for sections), `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections, etc.\n    ```markdown\n    ## My First Section\n    Some introductory text here.\n\n    ### A Sub-section\n    More details go here.\n    ```\n*   **Paragraphs:** Just type text. Separate paragraphs with a blank line.\n*   **Emphasis:** Use `*italic text*` or `_italic text_` and `**bold text**` or `__bold text__`.\n*   **Code:** For inline code snippets, use backticks: `` `println(\"Hello, JuliaHealth!\")` ``. (Note: Inline code typically still uses backticks in standard Markdown/Quarto).\n*   **Code Blocks:** For longer code examples, use triple tildes, optionally specifying the language for nice highlighting:\n\n    ```julia\n    using DICOM\n    # Load a DICOM file\n    dcm_data = dcm_parse(\"path/to/your/dicom_file.dcm\")\n    println(\"Patient Name: \", dcm_data[(0x0010, 0x0010)]) # Access DICOM tag\n    ```\n    *Tip:* If you uncommented `engine: julia` in the YAML header, Quarto can actually run this Julia code and include the output directly in your post!\n\n*   **Lists:**\n    *   Unordered (bullets): Use `-`, `*`, or `+` at the start of a line.\n        ```markdown\n        - First item\n        - Second item\n          * A nested item\n        ```\n    *   Ordered (numbers): Use `1.`, `2.`, etc.\n        ```markdown\n        1. Step one\n        2. Step two\n        ```\n*   **Links:** Use `[Text to display](URL)`.\n    ```markdown\n    Visit the [JuliaHealth GitHub](https://github.com/JuliaHealth).\n    ```\n*   **Images:** Use `![Alternative text description for accessibility](./image_filename.png)`. Put the image file (e.g., `image_filename.png`) in the *same folder* as your `.qmd` file. The alt text is important!\n    ```markdown\n    ![Diagram showing the workflow](./workflow-diagram.png)\n    *Optional: Add a caption below the image using italics.*\n    ```\n*   **Citations:** If you need to cite papers or other sources:\n    1.  Create a file named `references.bib` in the same folder as your `.qmd` file.\n    2.  Add entries in BibTeX format (you can often export these from reference managers like Zotero or sites like Google Scholar).\n        > ![\"Sample bibtex citation\"](./bibtex_sample.png)\n    3.  In your text, cite using the key: `[@Mitura2021MedEye3d]`. Quarto will format it and add it to a reference list at the end. Example: `This approach was used in MedEye3d [@Mitura2021MedEye3d].`\n\n**Write naturally!** Explain your concepts clearly. Use headings to structure your thoughts. Include code examples where helpful. Add images or diagrams if they aid understanding. Don't feel pressured to write a massive post; sometimes short, focused articles are the most useful.\n\n## Step 5: Add Supporting Files (Images, Data, Citations)\n\nRemember that any images you included using `![](./...)` and your `references.bib` file (if you used citations) need to actually *be* in the same folder as your `index.qmd` file. Double-check that the filenames match exactly.\n\n## Step 6: Preview Locally (See How It Looks!)\n\nThis is a crucial step! Before you ask others to review your post, you should see what it will look like when rendered as a webpage. Quarto makes this easy.\n\n1.  **Install Quarto:** If you haven't already, install Quarto from [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).\n2.  **Open Terminal:** Navigate back to the *root* directory of your cloned `JuliaHealthBlog` project in your terminal (the folder containing the `posts` directory, etc.).\n3.  **Run Preview:** Execute the `quarto preview` command, pointing it to your *specific post file*:\n\n    ~~~bash\n    # Make sure the path is correct!\n    quarto preview posts/2025-05-01-dicom-tools-intro/index.qmd\n    ~~~\n    *Alternatively, you might be able to preview the entire site, which will build all posts including yours:*\n    ~~~bash\n    # Sometimes this works better, especially if posts link to each other\n    # quarto preview\n    ~~~\n\n    Quarto will process your file (and potentially run code if you enabled the engine) and should automatically open a preview in your web browser.\n\n4.  **Review Carefully:** Check everything:\n    *   Is the text formatted correctly?\n    *   Do headings look right?\n    *   Do images appear and are they the right size?\n    *   Are code blocks highlighted properly? Did executed code produce the expected output?\n    *   Do links work?\n    *   Are citations rendered correctly? Is the reference list present?\n    *   Is the Table of Contents there (if you enabled it)?\n\n5.  **Iterate:** If you find mistakes, go back to your `.qmd` file, fix them, save the file, and Quarto's preview should update automatically in your browser (or you might need to re-run the `quarto preview` command). Repeat until you're happy.\n6.  **Stop Preview:** Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `quarto preview` is running to stop the local server.\n\n## Step 7: Commit and Push Your Changes (Save Your Work to GitHub)\n\nOkay, your post looks great locally! Now it's time to save your work using Git and send it up to *your fork* on GitHub. This involves three main Git commands: `add`, `commit`, and `push`.\n\n1.  **Best Practice: Create a Branch:** It's highly recommended to keep your blog post changes on a separate \"branch\". This isolates your work and makes the review process cleaner. From the root directory of `JuliaHealthBlog`:\n\n    ~~~bash\n    # Choose a descriptive branch name\n    git checkout -b add-dicom-intro-post\n    ~~~\n    This command creates a new branch named `add-dicom-intro-post` and switches you to it. All subsequent commits will be on this branch.\n\n2.  **Stage Your Files (`git add`):** Tell Git which files you want to include in your next save point. You need to add your `.qmd` file and any supporting files (images, `.bib`). The easiest way is often to add the entire directory you created:\n\n    ~~~bash\n    # Make sure the path is correct!\n    git add posts/2025-05-01-dicom-tools-intro/\n    ~~~\n\n3.  **Commit Your Changes (`git commit`):** Create a \"save point\" (a commit) with a descriptive message explaining what you did.\n\n    ~~~bash\n    git commit -m \"feat: Add blog post on introductory DICOM tools\"\n    # Or a simpler message:\n    # git commit -m \"Add blog post: Introduction to DICOM Tools\"\n    ~~~\n    *Good commit messages help everyone understand the history of the project.*\n\n4.  **Push to Your Fork (`git push`):** Send your new branch and its commit(s) from your local computer up to your fork on GitHub.\n\n    ~~~bash\n    # The '-u' sets up tracking for the branch on the first push\n    git push -u origin add-dicom-intro-post\n    ~~~\n    (Replace `add-dicom-intro-post` with your actual branch name). Git might ask for your GitHub username and password/token.\n\nYour changes are now safely stored on your GitHub fork!\n\n## Step 8: Open a Pull Request (PR) (Ask to Merge Your Post)\n\nThe final step! A Pull Request (PR) is how you formally propose your changes (your new blog post) to be merged into the *official* JuliaHealth blog repository.\n\n1.  **Go to GitHub:** Open your web browser and navigate to *your fork* of the `JuliaHealthBlog` repository on GitHub (`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/JuliaHealthBlog`).\n2.  **Start the PR:** You should see a yellow banner near the top saying your branch (`add-dicom-intro-post`) had recent pushes, with a green button \"Compare & pull request\". Click that button!\n    *   If you don't see the banner, go to the main `JuliaHealth/JuliaHealthBlog` repository **[confirm blog repo URL]**. Click the \"Pull requests\" tab, then the green \"New pull request\" button.\n    *   On the next screen, you need to ensure the settings are correct:\n        *   **Base repository:** `JuliaHealth/JuliaHealthBlog` Base branch: `main` (or `master`, **[confirm base branch name]**)\n        *   **Head repository:** `YOUR_USERNAME/JuliaHealthBlog` Compare branch: `add-dicom-intro-post` (your branch name)\n3.  **Write a Description:** Give your PR a clear title (e.g., \"Add Blog Post: Introduction to DICOM Tools\"). In the description box, briefly explain what your post is about. You can link to relevant issues if applicable. Be polite!\n    ~~~\n    Hi JuliaHealth maintainers,\n\n    This PR adds a new blog post titled \"Introduction to DICOM Tools in Julia\".\n    It covers basic loading and tag access using DICOM.jl.\n\n    Preview link (optional, if you deployed a preview somewhere): [link]\n\n    Thanks for reviewing!\n    ~~~\n4.  **Create the PR:** Click the green \"Create pull request\" button.\n\nThat's it! You've successfully submitted your blog post for review.\n\n# What Happens Next? (The Review Process)\n\nOnce you open the PR, one or more maintainers from the JuliaHealth community will review your submission.\n\n*   **Review:** They will read your post, check the code/formatting, and ensure it aligns with the blog's goals.\n*   **Feedback:** They might leave comments directly on the PR asking for clarifications, suggesting improvements, or pointing out minor typos. This is a normal, collaborative part of the process! Don't take it personally; feedback helps make the final post even better.\n*   **Updates:** If changes are requested, simply make the edits in your local `.qmd` file, then `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to the *same branch* (`add-dicom-intro-post`) on your fork. The PR on GitHub will update automatically with your new changes.\n*   **Approval & Merge:** Once the reviewers are happy, they will approve the PR and \"merge\" it. This integrates your post into the main blog repository.\n*   **Publication:** Depending on how the website is built, your post should appear live on the JuliaHealth blog shortly after merging! ðŸŽ‰\n\n# Need Help? Just Ask!\n\nFeeling stuck at any point? That's perfectly okay! The JuliaHealth community is friendly and helpful.
