## A Basic `IPUMS.jl` Workflow


This is just a first post to lay out a workflow for downloading and using US 
Census data from the IPUMS system. IPUMS.jl allows users to quickly read and 
process IPUMS data for subsequent analysis. 

## Pulling the Data

So the first part is to pull the data from the IPUMS website. We can do that
through a direct download of a zip file from the IPUMS website. Or soon we will 
be able to download an extract directly from the IPUMS.jl package. 

Once the extract is downloaded and extracted to a local directory, the user 
can use the IPUMS.jl package to process the contents of the file.
